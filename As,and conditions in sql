-- 'As' clause is used For given column name a new name
-- select first_name as first,last_name as last from actors;
-- ab question tha ki 'station' naam ki table di hui h usme se sbse largest and smallest city print krni thi uske liye query
***************************************question***********************************************///

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

Sample Output

ABC 3
PQRS 4
Explanation

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  and . The longest name is PQRS, but there are  options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

Note
You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.
//////////////////////////////////**********************************Answer is********************************************
Ans-
SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) AS Len FROM STATION order by Len,CITY limit 1;
SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) AS Len FROM STATION order by Len DESC,CITY limit 1;

-- here we learn two important concept one was 'AS' aur length function

Question 2
-- select bss print krne k liye hota h so 

--- ques ye h jo bhut concept sikhaega
--so ques is basically ek table di hui triangle name ki jisme a,b,c columns h jo side of triangle bta re h then print if each row is isoceles,equilateral,or scalene or none;

select 
    CASE
       WHEN  A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B THEN 
           CASE
                WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN "Equilateral"
                WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN "Isosceles"
                ELSE "Scalene"
           END
       ELSE "Not A Triangle"
    END
from TRIANGLES;

-- Ye Basically humne case statement kese use krenge sql m ye sikha so select basically print krane k liye hota h usme if else yah case aap khud jod skte ho
